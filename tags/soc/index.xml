&lt;h2 id="quick-summary"&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my lab time for OSWE/OSED courses just came to an end and I&amp;rsquo;m still way to far from being able to take their respective exams (still haven&amp;rsquo;t even reached the challenges, stuck on the material/excersises), so just as a way to take a short rest and a change of air from it, I decided to take a look around if there was anything similar to HTB but for Blue Team stuff (I barely know stuff related to it, besides my tasks as Appsec/DevSecOps whatever you want to call it mehh!), by doing this I ended up finding a web page called &amp;ldquo;Lets Defend&amp;rdquo;, it has some ctf alike games but focused exactly on the Blue Team side together with some Training content, which in a really easy and understandable way explains the 101 of SOC/Incident Response/SIEM, etc, pretty nice to have a quick and overview about that stuff, I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
