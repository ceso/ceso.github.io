&lt;h2 id="quick-summary"&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the last months I have been really away from doing write-ups, specifically due to being full focused on my OSCP which I still can&amp;rsquo;t belive I passed!! I did an extensive write up about my experience going through it, if you still haven&amp;rsquo;t read it &lt;a href="https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/04/a-journey-in-the-dark-an-adventures-tale-towards-oscp/"&gt;you can click here to go to it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more machines to do a write-up of, for example some of them are Postman, Traverxec, Mango, SolidState, OpenAdmin, Chatter Box among others, but well&amp;hellip;I will try to do them as my time allows me hehe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - AI</title><link>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/ai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/ai/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ceso.github.io/images/htb/ai/info-card.png" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /&gt;


&lt;h2 id="quick-summary"&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m posting the walk-through of this box, currently, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my OSCP so most of my free time goes dedicated to it :D.
At the time I did this box, I was only documenting with screenshots, so some dates could differ between the write up below as I accessed now to get plain text to not overload this with screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a box where for the foothold, you needed to upload a .wav file with a sql injection to get the reverse shell (the .wav is interpreted by an AI), and for the root you needed to exploit &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdwp-spec.html"&gt;JWDP&lt;/a&gt;, the idea of using an AI for the foothold, was original kudos for that, but the implementation of it, and the multiple tries-error with different &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis"&gt;TTS&lt;/a&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it, in summary, was a box I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like learning something new at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Bitlab</title><link>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/bitlab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/bitlab/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ceso.github.io/images/htb/bitlab/info-card.png" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /&gt;


&lt;h2 id="quick-summary"&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First than everything, I need to make clear that this box has 2 ways for doing privilege escalation: one is doing reversing and the other taking advantage of a misconfiguration with sudo and git. I will describe the steps for the &lt;code&gt;sudo + git&lt;/code&gt; path as I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to do my first steps into more low-level stuff. Despite this, in the future I will actualize this post to reflect also the reversing path.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Craft</title><link>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/craft/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ceso.github.io/posts/2020/craft/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ceso.github.io/images/htb/craft/info-card.png" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /&gt;


&lt;h2 id="quick-summary"&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So!!
Today was just retired Craft from Hack the box, this was a really fun box to do, and also I felt pretty well doing it, because even if I needed some nudges, it was actually the first box I got to the foothold without hints (elsen if I needed some guidance with python, thanks a lot @Frundrod!!), and afterward to get user I was a bit lost and also needed some hints (was not realizing something I have literally in my nose, thankss a lot &lt;a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/103596"&gt;@Fugl!&lt;/a&gt;), root was easy by a little bit of enumeration and reading help command output.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
